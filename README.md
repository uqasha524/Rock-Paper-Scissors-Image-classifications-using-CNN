# ‚úä‚úã‚úåÔ∏è Rock-Paper-Scissors Image Classification Using CNN

## üìå Project Overview  
This project classifies hand gestures into **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors** categories using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.  

To better understand performance differences, we first implemented traditional **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** approaches. These methods were limited in generalization capability for unseen image data, as they rely heavily on manually extracted features.  

This served as a **baseline comparison** to highlight the superior performance of CNNs, which can automatically learn spatial hierarchies from raw images. CNNs outperformed ML and ANN models significantly in terms of accuracy and robustness.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Overview  
We used an image dataset containing labeled hand gesture images:
- `rock/` ‚Äì images of a closed fist  
- `paper/` ‚Äì images of an open hand  
- `scissors/` ‚Äì images of two extended fingers

## üî¨ Traditional ML Models  

We trained several ML models using extracted image features:
```python
models = {
    "Logistic Regression": LogisticRegression(multi_class='multinomial', solver='lbfgs', max_iter=1000),
    "SVM (RBF Kernel)": SVC(kernel='rbf'),
    "Random Forest": RandomForestClassifier(),
    "k-NN": KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5),
    "Decision Tree": DecisionTreeClassifier(),
}
```

## üß† Why CNN?

CNNs were ultimately preferred because:

- üö´ No need for manual feature extraction  
- üìà Better performance on unseen image data  
- üß≠ Automatically learn spatial hierarchies from raw pixels  
- üí™ More scalable and robust for real-world applications
